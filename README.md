How to use this project?

Easy, just when type an operator just add a blank space and when you type an operand just make you sure if it's a word, it has been seperated
between other expressions. When you finish to type your expression end it with ";". For example:

  hello=2+a(2/2); 

And in the project should be:

  hello = 2 + a ( 2 / 2 ) ; 
  
I know it's uncomfortable but I just tried to make this project easier as posible. I hope you learn with this.
